# Sorting Algorithms Comparison (C++)

This project compares the performance of different sorting algorithms in C++: insertion sort, quicksort with midpoint pivot selection, and quicksort with median-of-three pivot selection. The program generates an array of 50,000 random integers and measures the runtime of each sorting algorithm.

This project was completed as part of a data structures and algorithms course.

## Technologies
- C++
- Standard Template Library (STL)

## Key concepts
- Insertion sort
- Quicksort (midpoint pivot)
- Quicksort (median-of-three pivot)
- Runtime measurement
- Random data generation

## How to compile and run

### Compile
```
g++ main.cpp -o sorting_comparison
```

### Run
```
./sorting_comparison
```

The program outputs the runtime in milliseconds for each sorting algorithm on the randomly generated dataset.

## What I learned
- Implementing and comparing different sorting algorithms
- Measuring algorithm efficiency using runtime data
- Understanding the impact of pivot selection on quicksort performance
